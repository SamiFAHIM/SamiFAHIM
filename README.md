**`Electrical Engineering Student (Embedded/Robotics/automation)`**

I'm Sami Fahim, an Electrical Engineering student at INSA Lyon with a deep passion for embedded systems, automation, and project management. I've gained valuable experience in each of these areas through diverse and hands-on experiences, fueling my drive to innovate and thrive.With hands-on experience in the energy sector, I've developed a deep understanding of high-stakes environments and the importance of precision and reliability.

Leadership is a core part of who I am‚Äîwhether it's guiding a team of 20 members representing my university in the [European Robotic Contest](https://www.eurobot.org/) or spearheading projects that push boundaries. I'm always looking for ways to inspire those around me and make a meaningful impact. I believe that a diverse range of interests is the key to sparking creativity and driving innovation, and I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share that vision.
